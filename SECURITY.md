# Security Policy

## Scope

This repository provides tooling for running Cloud Foundry **locally** on KIND
(Kubernetes in Docker) for development and testing purposes. It is **not**
intended for production deployments.

The deployment generates self-signed certificates, uses `--skip-ssl-validation`,
and runs all components on `127.0.0.1`. These are acceptable trade-offs for a
local development environment but would be security issues in production.

## Reporting Vulnerabilities

If you discover a security vulnerability in this fork's code (Makefile, scripts,
example apps, documentation), please report it through one of these channels:

1. **GitHub Security Advisories** (preferred): Use the "Report a vulnerability"
   button on the Security tab of this repository. This creates a private
   advisory visible only to maintainers.

2. **Email:** Contact the repository owner directly via their GitHub profile.

Please include:
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Affected files or components
- Severity assessment (critical, high, medium, low)

## Response Timeline

- **Acknowledgment:** Within 48 hours
- **Assessment:** Within 1 week
- **Fix (if applicable):** Depends on severity and upstream involvement

## Upstream Components

This repository deploys Cloud Foundry components (UAA, CAPI, Diego, Gorouter,
etc.) using their official Helm charts and container images. Security issues in
these components should be reported to the upstream Cloud Foundry project:

- **Cloud Foundry Security:** https://www.cloudfoundry.org/security/
- **CF Security Advisories:** https://www.cloudfoundry.org/blog/tag/security/

## Secrets Management

All secrets for the local deployment are auto-generated by `scripts/init.sh`
into the `temp/` directory, which is gitignored. Never commit the `temp/`
directory or its contents.
